# Project 4 👩🏽‍💻


The objective of this projet was to deepen the knowledge of lighting with the concept of pointlight and understand the basic principals of textures.
To do this, we created a chess board, using a texture. On top of the board there are a pool ball (with texture) and a magic cube (with texture and a bump map).
There are two light sources, one directional and one pointlight.

##  🚀 How to interact

1. Open the <code>index.html</code> file. To see the texxture locally, you have to change some browser configurations.

On Safari:

- Enable the develop menu using the preferences panel, under Advanced → "Show develop menu in menu bar".
- Then from the Safari "Develop" menu, select "Disable local file restrictions".
- If you are editing & debugging using Safari, it is advisable to also select the "Disable caches" option in the same menu.

On Chrome, start it with:
```
...\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe -allow-file-access-from-files
```

2. In this project you can:

- Start/stop the ball movement using the <code>B</code> key.
- Pause the visualization using the <code>S</code> key. Then, you can continue pressing the same key, or restart using the <code>R</code> key.
- Change the lighting:
  - Turn on/off the directional light source, using the <code>D</code> key.
  - Turn on/off the pointlight source, using the <code>P</code> key.
  - Turn on/off the lighting calculation, using the <code>L</code> key.
  - The whole scene can only be drawn on a wire model. Turn on/off this feature using the <code>W</code> key.
