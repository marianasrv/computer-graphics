# Project 4 👩🏽‍💻


The objective of this projet was to deepen the knowledge of lighting with the concept of pointlight and understand the basic principals of textures.
To do this, we created a chess board, using a texture. On top of the board there are a pool ball (with texture) and a magic cube (with texture and a bump map).
There are two light sources, one directional and one pointlight.

##  🚀 How to interact

In this project you can:

- Start/stop the ball movement using the <code>B</code> key.
- Pause the visualization using the <code>S</code> key. Then, you can continue pressing the same key, or restart using the <code>R</code> key.
- Change the lighting:
  - Turn on/off the directional light source, using the <code>D</code> key.
  - Turn on/off the pointlight source, using the <code>P</code> key.
  - Turn on/off the lighting calculation, using the <code>L</code> key.
  - The whole scene can only be drawn on a wire model. Turn on/off this feature using the <code>W</code> key.
