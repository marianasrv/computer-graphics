# Project 2 👩🏽‍💻


The objective of this projet was to create a field with walls. Inside, we had to introduce 10 balls with random positions, and random velocity.
Their velocity increases over the time. Besides, we had to detect the collisions between them and with the walls.


##  🚀 How to interact

</a>

1. Open the <code>index.html</code> file.
2. In this project you can:

- Change what perspective you want to see by changing the camera, using the <code>1</code>, <code>2</code> and <code>3</code> keys.
The camera 3 moves with a ball. The other two cameras are stationary.
- Remove the axis of the balls by clicking the <code>E</code> key.
