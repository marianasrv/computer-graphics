# Project 3 👩🏽‍💻


The objective of this projet was to work with lighting, and understand the concepts of material, directional light source and spotlight light source.
To do this, we created a plane, using polygon meshes. For the spotlight light source, we created 4 spotlights around the plane.


##  🚀 How to interact

</a>

1. Open the <code>index.html</code> file.
2. In this project you can:

- Move the plane, using the arrows (⬆️ up and ⬇️ down for the horizontal axis, and ⬅️ left and ➡️ right for the vertical axis).
- Turn on/off the spotlights individually, using the <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, <code>3</code> and <code>4</code> keys.
- Change the lighting:
  - Turn on/off the directional light source, using the <code>N</code> key, which switch between day and night.
  - Turn on/off the lighting calculation, using the <code>L</code> key.
  - Switch the type of shading betwwen Gouraud (<i>diffuse</i>) and Phong, using the <code>G</code> key.
